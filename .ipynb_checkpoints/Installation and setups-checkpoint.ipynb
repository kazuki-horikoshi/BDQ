    "# Overview of co-simulation setup\n",
    "To run the code, a co-simulation environment has to be setup correctly. It mainly has 3 parts:\n",
    "- A building model compiled into standard functional mock-up unit (FMU) format\n",
    "- A OpenAI gym interface wrapper for the FMU\n",
    "- A reinforcement learning (RL) code to interact with the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a high-fidelity model of the building with Modelica Buildings Library and then compiled it into a FMU. The lighting, occupant, and plug load schedule were created directly with 1-week measured data. The FMU, schedules and weather file are saved under the same folder (../agent/modelica).\n",
    "\n",
    "A customized OpenAI gym interface was developed based on Python library - PyFMI (https://github.com/modelon-community/PyFMI). After registering the gym environment, users can interact with the Modelica-based virtual environment using standard OpenAI gym command (refer to: https://gym.openai.com/docs/), such as `env.step`, `env.reset`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The branching dueling q-network (BDQ) was used as the RL agent to solve the multi-dimensional control task. The original BDQ code is open source (https://github.com/atavakol/action-branching-agents). We mainly modified the `procedure_continuous_tasks.py`, `train_continuous.py` and `enjoy_continuous.py` files and make them work in our virtual environment. "

    "# Installation\n",
    "The installation can be troublesome and prone to error. Please feel free to email me if you encounter any problem. The Python version must be 3.6, and we will install PyFMI, tensorflow, OpenAI, and special version of Numpy. I only tested this workflow in Ubuntu but it should also work for other platforms. However, the FMU is platform-specific, meaning that you will need to compile the Modelica model in the Windows FMU format in order to run it in the Windows system.\n",
